      {
        "question": "Can foreign investors buy property in Brazil?",
        "answer": "Yes! Foreign investors can buy property in Brazil without restrictions, except in border areas and rural zones that require Congressional approval. I assist with the entire legal process and documentation required for international investors."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents are required for international investors?",
        "answer": "You will need a valid passport, Brazilian CPF (tax document), proof of address, and sworn translated documents. I help with obtaining the CPF and all necessary documentation, making the process simple and fast."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does payment work for overseas investors?",
        "answer": "Payments can be made via international wire transfer, through a Brazilian account, or via foreign exchange contracts. I work with banking institutions specialized in international operations to ensure security and the best exchange rates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I get a mortgage as a foreigner?",
        "answer": "Yes, foreign residents in Brazil can obtain financing. For non-residents, payment is usually in cash, but there are alternatives for direct installment plans with developers. I present the best options according to your profile."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the average return on investment in Balneário Camboriú?",
        "answer": "The region shows average appreciation of 8-15% per year and rental yield of 0.5-1% per month. Balneário Camboriú is known as the 'Brazilian Dubai' due to accelerated growth and high-standard developments. I provide detailed ROI analysis for each opportunity."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does taxation work for foreign investors?",
        "answer": "Foreign investors pay the same taxes as Brazilians: ITBI on purchase (2-3%), annual IPTU (varies by municipality), and capital gains tax on sale (15-22.5%). I work with accountants specialized in international taxation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer support in other languages?",
        "answer": "Yes! I provide service in Portuguese, English, and Spanish. All communication and documentation can be conducted in your preferred language to ensure complete understanding of the process."

        "question": "Can I manage my investment remotely?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! I offer complete remote management service, including rental administration, maintenance, construction monitoring, and periodic reports. You invest with peace of mind from anywhere in the world."
